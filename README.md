# Scala
Final Project
Create a single program/game/application:

Tic-tac-toe - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

For the above games and other games, a requirement is that you store/retrieve some data from 
a simple database (single table for high scores is fine, maybe table storing 
game scores - Alice 1 Bob 0 etc).

You can add more complicated database operations.

Other ideas:


5) TODO / TaskList manager - Tasks saved into a database (SQLite is fine)
6) Text File Parser -> Save to Text or better to Database
7) CSV File Parser / Filter -> Save Text Report, Save Result into Database
8) Student's own ideas - again something involving an SQL database would be a huge plus

Students work in groups of 2 (ask if you want to work in groups of 3 )
We will generate random teams.
Programs will run in text mode.


Recommend splitting your work in such a way so you can work on separate Classes, will be easier smile
Review each other's work.
Comment your code.
Add documentation comments in Scaladoc style: https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/scaladoc.html
